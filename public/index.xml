      <description>Throughout my career, I have worked in many different positions and sectors to contribute positive business results by performing another level of prioritization to increase productivity. The experience that I have gained over the years, allows me to understand people easily and communicate with them in an effective way. While Iâ€™m independently motivated, I do appreciate collective efforts and collaborate productively within group settings.
Music I love discovering new tracks trough Soundcloud and in the Blog section you may find some cool ones to chill or dance.</description>
