<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper investigates the relationship between the average expenditure per tourist which is calculated as total travel incomes divided by the total number of departing visitors, the exchange rate and inflation of package holidays by using OLS method. The analysis has covered the period of 2005 â€“ 2018 on a monthly basis. The empirical results have stated that the exchange rate volatility and the inflation of package holidays have a negative and statistically significant effect on the average expenditure per tourist.</p>
