Throughout my career, I have worked in many different positions and sectors to contribute positive business results by performing another level of prioritization to increase productivity. The experience that I have gained over the years, allows me to understand people easily and communicate with them in an effective way. While Iâ€™m independently motivated, I do appreciate collective efforts and collaborate productively within group settings.


## **Music**

I love discovering new tracks trough [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/rohatalp) and in the Blog section you may find some cool ones to chill or dance. The Genre that you will face is mostly techno which is more like various types of ethnic nuances. 


## **Travel** 

During my education time, I have found the chance for traveling some countries around the US and Europe. There will be some posts and notes about that also in the Blog page.
