Throughout my career, I have worked in many different positions and sectors to contribute positive business results by performing another level of prioritization to increase productivity. The experience that I have gained over the years, allows me to understand people easily and communicate with them in an effective way. While Iâ€™m independently motivated, I do appreciate collective efforts and collaborate productively within group settings. 


## Setup

Some fun facts about [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/):

* Built in [Go](http://golang.org/)
* Loosely inspired by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* Primarily developed by [spf13](http://spf13.com/) on the train while commuting to and from Manhattan.
* Coded in [Vim](http://vim.org) using [spf13-vim](http://vim.spf13.com/)

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/spf13).
